            <b>ABSTRACT</b>
        </p>
        <p class="a">
            The Integrated Learning Project (ILP) is a learning program that combines several subjects into a large,
            medium, or small project. <b>Students are encouraged to think critically in solving various problems and to
            enhance their creativity through the Integrated Learning Project. Furthermore, students are prepared for the
            future by being engaged in projects that require communication, skills, and creativity, which helps them
            become accustomed to socializing, collaborating, and thinking creatively in their work.</b> Through this
            project, students are expected to understand its purpose and objectives and apply them in daily life.
        </p>
        <p class="b">
            The Integrated Learning Project for grade IX involves organizing a bazaar. In addition, students are also
            required to hold a performance. This year's bazaar carries the theme "PUSPANUSA," stands for Pentas Seni dan
            Pertunjukan Anak Nusantara, which is going to be our practical exam. <b>Indonesia’s diversity was the focus of
            the entire bazaar.</b> That is why “Nusantara on the Table” is the name of our group. <b>Various products, foods,
            and drinks that contained Indonesian characteristics were presented, sold, and served at our booth. Six
            months were taken to prepare for this entire bazaar,</b> from building ideas for what to sell, having dissent
            about the budget, the booth design, decoration, and performance, until the finished products and show that
            we would be presenting. It was not an easy project, it was a big major project. <b>Why was this bazaar
            considered meaningful to all of us?</b>
        </p>
        <p class="c">
            This project was very new to all of us and <b>everything was done together from scratch.</b> From creating the name
            of our group, picking the product that we will sell, until decorating our booth and practicing our
            performance. It was very hard, tiring, but also fun. One of the most difficult things to do was setting a
            budget. <b>The budget was not determined by the teacher,</b> so setting our budget was quite hard and there were a
            lot of arguments. <b>Moreover, effective time management was necessary to be maintained.</b> The deadline between
            each task was quite tight and also, we still had homework from other subjects. <b>Therefore, teamwork and time
            management were considered very important.</b>
        </p>
        <p class="d">
            The major point that we all learned from this project is how we trust one another and <b>how the time should be
            managed.</b> At first we were quite shy and awkward. But after working together from time to time, our
            solidarity begins to build. We get to understand each other more. We understand that trust, communication,
            and time management is the key for success
